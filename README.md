# Data Structures and Algorithms - Java Implementation

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rafaelcfreire/Java-Algorithms.png)](https://travis-ci.org/rafaelcfreire/java_algorithms)


A simple Java project with implementation of popular algorithms for sorting and searching. I will try to update it as often as possible, feel free to fork and improve it.
Currently contains:
* Binary Tree
* BubbleSort
* InsertionSort
* SelectionSort

It is a "mavenized" project, but his pom.xml file only contains a dependency for Junit.
