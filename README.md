# Data Structures and Algorithms - Java Implementation

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rafaelcfreire/java_algorithms.png)](https://travis-ci.org/rafaelcfreire/java_algorithms)

A Java project with implementation of popular data structures and algorithms. I will try to update it as often as possible, feel free to fork and improve it.

## Sorting Algorithms
* [Bubble Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort)
* [Insertion Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort)
* [Selection Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort)

## Search Trees
* [Binary Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree) 

## Stack
* [Array Based Stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)#Array) - Each method runs in a constant time <i>O(1)</i>. The space usage is <i>O(N)</i> where <i>N</i> is the size of the array, independent of the number n of elements.
* [Singly Linked List Stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)#Linked_list) - Different from an array based Stack, the singly linked list Stack has memory usage proportional to the number of actual elements currently in the stack. This is a best choice when the final number of elements in the stack is not known.

## Queue

It is a "mavenized" project, but his pom.xml file only contains a dependency for Junit.
