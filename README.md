Examples taken from the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Data-Structures-Algorithms-Michael-Goodrich/dp/1118771338/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1441142177&sr=1-1&keywords=data+structures+and+algorithms+in+java+6th+edition&pebp=1441142169982&perid=0ZQ0Q3XPRFZPWF6SMCAA">Data Structures and Algorithms in Java - 6th Edition</a>

A simple Java project with implementation of popular algorithms for sorting and searching. I will try to update it as often as possible, feel free to fork and improve it.
Currently contains:
* Binary Tree
* BubbleSort
* InsertionSort
* SelectionSort

It is a "mavenized" project, but his pom.xml file only contains a dependency for Junit.
