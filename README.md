# Data Structures and Algorithms - Java Implementation

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rafaelcfreire/java_algorithms.png)](https://travis-ci.org/rafaelcfreire/java_algorithms)

A Java project with implementation of popular data structures and algorithms. I will try to update it as often as possible, feel free to fork and improve it.
Currently contains:
* Binary Tree - 
* Bubble Sort -
* Insertion Sort - 
* Selection Sort -
* Array Based Stack - Each method runs in a constant time <i>O(1)</i>. The space usage is <i>O(N)</i> where <i>N</i> is the size of the array, independent of the number n of elements.
* Singly Linked List Stack - Different from an array based Stack, the singly linked list Stack has memory usage proportional to the number of actual elements currently in the stack. This is a best choice when the final number of elements in the stack is not known.

It is a "mavenized" project, but his pom.xml file only contains a dependency for Junit.
